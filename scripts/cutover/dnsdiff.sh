# Verifies that the new nameservers serve the same zone the old ones did
# (task 6.3d). Written as a pre-delegation gate; delegation was changed on
# 2026-08-28, so it now runs as an after-the-fact check. While the old
# nameservers still answer, the comparison is still worth having.
#
#   ./dnsdiff.sh [--list] [capture-dir]

#     --list   print the expected record matrix and exit; no DNS queries, so it
#              works anywhere and shows exactly what coverage you are getting.
#
# THE CHECK LIST COMES FROM THE CAPTURE, NOT FROM A LIST IN THIS FILE
#
# The first version of this script hardcoded the domains and subdomains to
# check. Both of its blind spots came from that, and neither was visible in its
# output:
#
#   * It queried `securityscorecard.dev`. The zone is `securityscorecards.dev`
#     -- plural. Every lookup for it returned empty from both nameservers, and
#     a "skip if neither has a record" guard turned 20 silent failures into a
#     clean-looking section with no rows. api.securityscorecards.dev is one of
#     the two published API hostnames and it went unverified while the report
#     read as though the domain had passed.
#   * Its subdomain list was ("" api api-staging www), which omits the four
#     `_acme-challenge` CNAMEs. Those are the records whose loss is invisible
#     for weeks and then breaks Fastly TLS renewal -- exactly the ones a
#     pre-delegation check exists to catch.
#
# So the expected set is read from capture-config.sh's `dns-records-*.json`,
# which is what Cloud DNS actually served. A name cannot be missed by being
# forgotten, only by being absent from the capture. Silence is never success:
# a record in the capture that the new nameserver does not answer for is a
# hard failure, not a skipped row.
#
# Requires `dig` and `jq`, and network access to both nameservers.
